# Unity Runtime Input Debug
Simpe unity input debul tool that displays currently pressed input on the screen.

Useful when recording gameplay demo for issue reporting or demonstrating how input is handled and translated into the game.

**Current implementation depends on the legacy Unity Input System. I plan to extend the tools to support the new input system.**
